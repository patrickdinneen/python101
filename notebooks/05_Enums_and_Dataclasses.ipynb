    "Python will still allow us to pass any values in when constructing `NavigationInstruction`. This is because Python doesn't do any type checking at run time. We can use `MyPy` to run static analysis of our code and ensure that it we aren't passing invalid values in (this is definitely a good thing to do) but the greater value comes from communicating our intent clearly to our future selves and collaborators.\n",
